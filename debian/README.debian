KDE NOTICE
==========

There used to be two versions of kde.deb : one made by debian, and
one made by the KDE team. Fortunatly this has changed to the better
and this package is both: the debian package and the kde package.

Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@debian.org> used to maintain the debian part
and I took over, when he orphaned them.

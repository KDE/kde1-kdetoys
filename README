Common Mistakes
---------------

IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory where KDE is
installed.  If this variable is not set, strange things may happen.  
Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims Qt cannot be found, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of Qt, version 1.41 or newer.

Debugging
---------

You can use --enable-debug with the configure script, if you want to have
debug code in your KDE apps and libs.  I recommend to do this, since this
is alpha software and this makes debugging things a whole lot easier.

Removal/Uninstallation
----------------------

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completely.

More Info
---------

Have a look at the individual subdirectories, if you want to know, what
versions of apps are included.

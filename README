IMPORTANT: most applications need KDEDIR as the directory, where KDE is 
installed. Please set this in your login file.

If configure claims about missing Qt, have a look at http://www.troll.no
to get a copy of qt-1.3 or higher. 

You can use --enable-debug, if you want to have debug code in your
KDE apps and libs. I recommend to do this, since this is alpha soft-
ware and you better have the possibility to check, what was wrong.

You can use 'make uninstall' if you want to remove the kde from the dirs.
This feature has not been tested completly.
